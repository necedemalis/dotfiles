      <text>Ninety-nine in a hundred of what are called
educated men are in this condition, even of those who can argue
fluently for their opinions. Their conclusion may be true, but it
might be false for anything they know: they have never thrown
themselves into the mental position of those who think differently
from them, and considered what such persons may have to say; and
consequently they do not, in any proper sense of the word, know the
doctrine which they themselves profess.</text>

      <text>That the only purpose for which power can be
rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community,
against his will, is to prevent harm to others. His own good,
either physical or moral, is not a sufficient warrant. He cannot
rightfully be compelled to do or forbear because it will be better
for him to do so, because it will make him happier, because, in the
opinions of others, to do so would be wise, or even right. These
are good reasons for remonstrating with him, or reasoning with him,
or persuading him, or entreating him, but not for compelling him,
or visiting him with any evil, in case he do otherwise. To justify
that, the conduct from which it is desired to deter him must be
calculated to produce evil to some one else. The only part of the
conduct of any one, for which he is amenable to society, is that
which concerns others. In the part which merely concerns himself,
his independence is, of right, absolute. Over himself, over his own
body and mind, the individual is sovereign.</text>

heretical opinions do not perceptibly gain or even lose, ground in
each decade or generation; they never blaze out far and wide, but
continue to smoulder in the narrow circles of thinking and studious
persons among whom they originate, without ever lighting up the
general affairs of mankind with either a true or a deceptive light.
And thus is kept up a state of things very satisfactory to some

when it has come to be an hereditary creed, and to be received
passively, not actively—when the mind is no longer compelled, in
the same degree as at first, to exercise its vital powers on the
questions which its belief presents to it, there is a progressive
tendency to forget all of the belief except the formularies, or to
give it a dull and torpid assent, as if accepting it on trust
dispensed with the necessity of realizing it in consciousness, or
testing it by personal experience; until it almost ceases to
connect itself at all with the inner life of the human being. Then
are seen the cases, so frequent in this age of the world as almost
to form the majority, in which the creed remains as it were outside
the mind, encrusting and petrifying it against all other influences
addressed to the higher parts of our nature; manifesting its power
by not suffering any fresh and living conviction to get in, but
itself doing nothing for the mind or heart, except standing
sentinel over them to keep them vacant.

      <text>First, if any opinion is compelled to silence, that opinion may,
for aught we can certainly know, be true. To deny this is to assume
our own infallibility.
Secondly, though the silenced opinion be an error, it may, and
very commonly does, contain a portion of truth; and since the
general or prevailing opinion on any object is rarely or never the
whole truth, it is only by the collision of adverse opinions that
the remainder of the truth has any chance of being supplied.
Thirdly, even if the received opinion be not only true, but the
whole truth; unless it is suffered to be, and actually is,
vigorously and earnestly contested, it will, by most of those who
receive it, be held in the manner of a prejudice, with little
comprehension or feeling of its rational grounds. And not only
this, but, fourthly, the meaning of the doctrine itself will be in
danger of being lost, or enfeebled, and deprived of its vital
effect on the character and conduct: the dogma becoming a mere
formal profession, inefficacious for good, but cumbering the

conviction, from reason or personal experience.</text>

Were the duty of enforcing universal education once admitted,
there would be an end to the difficulties about what the State
should teach, and how it should teach, which now convert the
subject into a mere battle-field for sects and parties, causing the
time and labor which should have been spent in educating, to be
wasted in quarrelling about education. If the government would make
up its mind to require for every child a good education, it might
save itself the trouble of providing one. It might leave to parents
to obtain the education where and how they pleased, and content
itself with helping to pay the school fees of the poorer classes of
children, and defraying the entire school expenses of those who
have no one else to pay for them. The objections which are urged
with reason against State education, do not apply to the
enforcement of education by the State, but to the State's taking
upon itself to direct that education: which is a totally different
thing. That the whole or any large part of the education of the
people should be in State hands, I go as far as any one in
deprecating. All that has been said of the importance of
individuality of character, and diversity in opinions and modes of
conduct, involves, as of the same unspeakable importance, diversity 
of education. A general State education is a mere contrivance for
moulding people to be exactly like one another: and as the mould in
which it casts them is that which pleases the predominant power in
the government, whether this be a monarch, a priesthood, an
aristocracy, or the majority of the existing generation, in
proportion as it is efficient and successful, it establishes a
despotism over the mind, leading by natural tendency to one over
the body. An education established and controlled by the State,
should only exist, if it exist at all, as one among many competing
experiments, carried on for the purpose of example and stimulus, to
keep the others up to a certain standard of excellence.</text>

      <text>In
many cases, though individuals may not do the particular thing so
well, on the average, as the officers of government, it is
nevertheless desirable that it should be done by them, rather than
by the government, as a means to their own mental education—a mode
of strengthening their active faculties, exercising their judgment,
and giving them a familiar knowledge of the subjects with which
they are thus left to deal. This is a principal, though not the
sole, recommendation of jury trial (in cases not political); of
free and popular local and municipal institutions; of the conduct
of industrial and philanthropic enterprises by voluntary
associations.</text>

      <text>If indeed all the high talent of the country could
be drawn into the service of the government, a proposal tending to
bring about that result might well inspire uneasiness. If every
part of the business of society which required organized concert,
or large and comprehensive views, were in the hands of the
government, and if government offices were universally filled by
the ablest men, all the enlarged culture and practised intelligence
in the country, except the purely speculative, would be
concentrated in a numerous bureaucracy, to whom alone the rest of
the community would look for all things: the multitude for
direction and dictation in all they had to do; the able and
aspiring for personal advancement. To be admitted into the ranks of
this bureaucracy, and when admitted, to rise therein, would be the
sole objects of ambition. Under this regime, not only is the
outside public ill-qualified, for want of practical experience, to
criticize or check the mode of operation of the bureaucracy, but
even if the accidents of despotic or the natural working of popular
institutions occasionally raise to the summit a ruler or rulers of
reforming inclinations, no reform can be effected which is contrary
to the interest of the bureaucracy. Such is the melancholy
condition of the Russian empire, as is shown in the accounts of
those who have had sufficient opportunity of observation.</text>

      <text>. A government cannot have too
much of the kind of activity which does not impede, but aids and
stimulates, individual exertion and development. The mischief
begins when, instead of calling forth the activity and powers of
individuals and bodies, it substitutes its own activity for theirs;
when, instead of informing, advising, and upon occasion denouncing,
it makes them work in fetters or bids them stand aside and does
their work instead of them. The worth of a State, in the long run,
is the worth of the individuals composing it; and a State which 
postpones the interests of their mental expansion and elevation, to
a little more of administrative skill or that semblance of it which
practice gives, in the details of business; a State, which dwarfs
its men, in order that they may be more docile instruments in its
hands even for beneficial purposes, will find that with small men
no great thing can really be accomplished; and that the perfection
of machinery to which it has sacrificed everything, will in the end
avail it nothing, for want of the vital power which, in order that
the machine might work more smoothly, it has preferred to
banish</text>
