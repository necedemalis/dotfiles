I brainstormed a little bit and came up with some titles that seem somehow "noir" to me (whatever that
means exactly):

Thelonious Monk - Round Midnight
Duke Ellington - In a Sentimental Mood
John Coltrane - Naima
Ornette Coleman - Lonely Woman http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNbD1JIH344
Sonny Criss - Sunrise, Sunset 
Modern Jazz Quartet - Django
Andrew Hill - Black Monday
