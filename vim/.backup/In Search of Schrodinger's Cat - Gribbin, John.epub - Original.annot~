But what the uncertainty principle tells us is that, according to the fundamental equation of quantum mechanics, there is no such thing as an electron that possesses both a precise momentum and a precise position.</text>

      <text>most stable form. Inside stars, the lightest nuclei, hydrogen and helium, are converted into heavier nuclei in a series of nuclear reactions that fuse the light nuclei together, making elements such as carbon and oxygen along the road to iron, and releasing energy as a result. When some stars explode as supernovae, a great deal of gravitational energy is put into the nuclear processes, and this pushes the fusion beyond iron to make heavier elements, including things like uranium and plutonium. When heavy elements move back toward the most stable configuration, by ejecting nucleons in the form of alpha particles, electrons, positrons, or individual neutrons, they too release energy, which is essentially the stored-up energy of a long-gone supernova explosion. An alpha particle is essentially the nucleus of a helium atom and contains two protons and two neutrons. By ejecting such a particle, a nucleus reduces its mass by four units, and its atomic number by two. And it does so in accordance with the rules of quantum mechanics and the uncertainty relations discovered by Heisenberg.</text>

When we do, we get the usual pattern on our screen for single-hole experiments. When we open both holes together, however, we do not get the pattern produced by adding up those two patterns, as we would for bullets. Instead, we get the pattern for interference by waves. And we still get this pattern if we slow down our electron gun so much that only one electron at a time goes through the whole setup. One electron goes through only one hole, we would guess, and arrives at our detector; then another electron is let through, and so on. If we wait patiently for enough electrons to pass through, the pattern that builds up on our detector screen is the diffraction pattern for waves.</text>

      <text>.This misconception still arises today, partly because of the way the idea of uncertainty is often taught. Heisenberg himself used the idea of observing an electron to make his point. We can only see things by looking at them, which involves bouncing photons of light off them and into our eyes. A photon doesn’t disturb an object like a house very much, so we don’t expect the house to be affected by looking at it. For an electron, though, things are rather different. To start with, because an electron is so small we have to use electromagnetic energy with a short wavelength in order to see it (with the aid of experimental apparatus)at all. Such gamma radiation is very energetic, and any photon of gamma radiation that bounces off an electron and can be detected</text>

      <text>band; in a conductor, some have overflowed into the conduction band.* In a semiconductor, the valence band is full, and there is only a narrow energy gap between this band and the conduction band—typically about 1 eV. So it is easy for an electron to hop into the conduction band and carry an electric current through the material. Unlike the situation for a conductor, though, this electron that has gained energy leaves a hole behind in the valence band. In exactly the same way that Dirac reasoned for the creation of electrons and positrons out of energy, this absence of a negatively charged electron in the valence band behaves, as far as electrical properties are concerned, like a positive charge. So a natural semiconductor typically has a few electrons in its conduction band, and a few positively charged holes in its valence band, both of which can convey electric current. You can think of successive electrons falling into the hole in the valence band and leaving a hole behind them, into which the next electron hops, and so on; or you can think of the holes as real, positive particles moving in the opposite direction. As far as electric currents are concerned, the effect is the same.</text>

      <text>Feynman explains the basic recipe simply. In quantum mechanics, an “event” is a set of initial and final conditions, no more and no less. An electron leaves the gun on one side of our apparatus, and the electron arrives at a particular detector on the other side of the holes. That is an event. The probability of an event is given by the square of a number which is, essentially, Schrodinger’s wave function, ω. If there is more than one way in which the event can occur (both holes are open inside the experiment), then the probability</text>

      <text>We can try peeking, to “see” which hole the electron goes through. When the equivalent of this experiment is carried out, the result is even more bizarre. Imagine an arrangement that records which hole an electron goes through but lets it pass on its way to the detector screen. Now the electrons behave like normal, self-respecting everyday particles. We always see an electron at one hole or the other, never both at once. And now the pattern that builds up on the detector screen is exactly equivalent to the pattern for bullets, with no trace of interference. The electrons not only know whether or not both holes are open, they know whether or not we are watching them, and they adjust their behavior accordingly. There is no clearer example of the interaction of the observer with the experiment. When we try to look at the spread-out electron wave, it collapses into a definite particle, but when we are not looking it keeps its options open.</text>

      <text>. As particles go, mesons are massive. The particular mesons involved in the strong nuclear interaction were found in cosmic radiation in 1946, and are called pi mesons, or pions. The uncharged or neutral pion has a mass 264 times that of the electron, and both the positive and negative pion weigh in at 273 electron masses. In round terms, they have about one seventh of the mass of a proton. Yet two protons are held together in the nucleus by exchanging, repeatedly, pions that weigh a good fraction of the protons’ own weight, and without the protons losing any mass themselves. This is only possible because the protons are able to take advantage of the uncertainty principle. A pion is created, crosses to another proton and disappears all in the twinkling of uncertainty allowed while the universe “isn’t looking.” Protons and neutrons—nucleons—can only exchange mesons when they are very close together, essentially when they are “touching,” to use an inappropriate expression from the everyday world. Otherwise, the virtual pions cannot get across the gap during the time allowed by the uncertainty principle.</text>

Strictly speaking, the electrons can only do the trick with the aid of a photon, and the protons with the aid of a meson, to provide the “scattering” required. A photon that doesn’t exist creates a positron/electron pair, that then annihilate to produce the photon that created them in the first place—remember, the photon doesn’t know the difference between future and past. Alternatively, an electron can be imagined chasing its own tail in a time eddy. First it appears, popping out of the vacuum like a rabbit out of a magician’s hat, then it travels forward in time a short distance before realizing its mistake, acknowledging its own unreality, and turning around to go back from whence it came, backward through time to its starting place. There, it changes direction again, and so the loop continues, with the aid of a photon interaction—a high-energy scattering event—at each “end” of the loop.</text>

      <text>.But don’t be too disappointed, for the Aspect experiment and its predecessors do indeed make for a very different world view from that of our everyday common sense. They tell us that particles that were once together in an interaction remain in some sense parts of a single system, which responds together to further interactions. Virtually everything we see and touch and feel is made up of collections of particles that have been involved in interactions with other particles right back through time, to the Big Bang in which the universe as we know it came into being.

      <text>body are made of particles that once jostled in close proximity in the cosmic fireball with particles that are now part of a distant star, and particles that form the body of some living creature on some distant, undiscovered planet. Indeed, the particles that make up my body once jostled in close proximity and interacted with the particles that now make up your body. We are as much parts of a single system as the two photons flying out of the heart of the Aspect experiment.Theorists such as d’Espagnat and David Bohm argue that we must accept that, literally, everything is connected to everything else, and only a holistic approach to the universe is likely to explain phenomena such as human consciousness.</text>
