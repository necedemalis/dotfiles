00001 Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the
00002 bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the
00003 book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in
00004 it, 'and what is the use of a book,' thought Alice 'without pictures or
00005 conversation?'
00006 
00007 So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the
00008 hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure
00009 of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and
00010 picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran
00011 close by her.
00012 
00013 There was nothing so VERY remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so
00014 VERY much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, 'Oh dear!
00015 Oh dear! I shall be late!' (when she thought it over afterwards, it
00016 occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time
00017 it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually TOOK A WATCH
00018 OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT-POCKET, and looked at it, and then hurried on,
00019 Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had
00020 never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch
00021 to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field
00022 after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large
00023 rabbit-hole under the hedge.
