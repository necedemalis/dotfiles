Margarita
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Margarita
Ah, ah, ah, ah

It was in Pittsburgh, late one night
I lost my head, got into a fight
I rolled and tumbled till I saw the light
Went to the Big Apple, took a bite

Ah, ah, ah, ah

Still the sun went down your way
Down from the blue into the gray
Where I stood, I saw you walk away
(Margarita) You danced away

Ah, ah, ah, ah

I asked her what we're gonna do tonight
She said, "Cahuenga Langa-Langa Shoe Box Soup"
We better keep tryin' till we get it right
Tala mala sheela jaipur dhoop

She wrote a long letter on a short piece of paper
Oh Margarita
