O Lord, help me walk
Another mile, just one more mile;
I'm tired of walkin' all alone.

And Lord, Help me to smile
Another smile, just one more smile;
Don't think I can do things on my own.

I never thought I needed help before;
I thought that I could get by - by myself.
But now I know I just can't take it any more.
With a humble heart, on bended knee,
I'm beggin' You, please, for help.

O come down from Your golden throne 
To me, to lowly me;
I need to feel the touch of Your tender hand.
Release these chains of darkness
Let me see, Lord, let me see;
Just where I fit into your master plan.

I never thought I needed help before;
I thought that I could get by - by myself.
Now I know I just can't take it any more.
And with a humble heart, on bended knee,
I'm beggin' You, please, for Help.
And with a humble heart, on bended knee,
I'm beggin' You, please, for Help.
